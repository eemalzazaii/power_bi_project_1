### Preprocessing
```
is_null = df.isnull().sum()
print('Null value:',is_null)
is_duplacted = df.duplicated().sum()
print("Duplicated value",is_duplacted)

```

chart1 = figure(title = 'Sales per company',x_axis_label= 'Company',y_axis_label = 'Units Sold',x_range = platforms,height=400, 
           width=300)
chart2 = figure(title = 'Most Popular Supplements in Canada (By Sales)',x_axis_label = 'Supplements',y_axis_label = 'Units Sold',x_range = product1, width = 1400, height= 600)
